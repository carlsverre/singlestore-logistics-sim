Future home of a large scale logistics demo using SingleStore and Redpanda.  Stay tuned :)

## Usage

This allows you to run up to 4 nodes up to 32 gigs each for free. Grab your license key from [SingleStore portal](https://msql.co/3fZoxjO) and set it as an environment variable.

2. Run the simulation with `docker-compose up`.

```bash
export SINGLESTORE_LICENSE="<<singlestore license>>"
docker-compose up
```
